# Photo App

Web application done with React and Redux. The application is a photo app that enables users to search and download photos from the Unsplash API. Users can also add these photos to their personal collection of favorites. Within this personal collection, users have the ability to add or modify photo descriptions, filter images based on descriptions, order images by date, width, height, or likes, and download the images. Additionally, clicking on a photo in the favorites collection provides users with an enlarged view of the image, allowing them to see it in greater detail.
